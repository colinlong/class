					<p><strong>Re-clad or repair?</strong> This is the one of the most difficult choices facing owners of synthetic stucco homes. When moisture intrudes the E.I.F.S. wall, the synthetic stucco coating tends to trap it. This trapped water causes the mold growth and rot of the house wooden structure.<br><br>Many concerns arose regarding this issue and the overall performance of E.I.F.S. Some theories blame misapplication of E.I.F.S. materials, improper interface of E.I.F.S. with other components (such as windows, doors, and flashing), and defective construction materials- to an all out condemnation of E.I.F.S.<br><br>The E.I.F.S. manufacturers and many builders contend that repair of E.I.F.S. is sufficient to restore the systems’ reliability. Proponents of the repair argue that actual damage to the sheathing and framing of most synthetic houses is below 10%, and can be addressed without total replacement. They also point to the substantial cost differences between repairs and replacement.</p>

					<h4>Masonry</h4><br><p>Our concrete mixture provides repairs in cracked or broken concrete and that are virtually undetectable. Traditional concrete is rated at 2500 psi; our concrete product is engineered to a 4200 psi rating.</p><br>
					<h4>Brick Restoration</h4><br><p>We use an industry-surpassing compound that provides seamless repair work to cracked brick and mortar on a structure or on a sidewalk or driveway. Traditional mortar is rated at 750 psi; our product is rated at 4200 psi.</p><br>
					<h4>Brick, mortar, and concrete painting/staining</h4><br><p>We worked diligently to create paint products that perfectly match existing colors and sustain through the changing weather climates of the Delaware Valley. These products should not fade, peel, or chip when properly applied, and our paints have a twenty-year life expectancy rate. Our paints are also heat, slip, and mildew resistant and never require a sealant.</p>

				<h3 id="lime">limestone</h3><br>
				<div class="low-content-left">
					<p>Limestone is a widely used architectural stone. Many of the world’s most recognized and loved landmarks, including the Great Pyramids, are constructed from this versatile, attractive stone. Limestone occurs in nature in varying degrees of hardness – some varieties are extremely soft – and like marble, limestone is very susceptible to acids, which can scratch and damage it.</p><br><br>
					<p>Caring for limestone effectively requires specialized knowledge because many types of limestone are extremely soft. Some varieties of limestone, particularly the softer varieties, need to be professionally cleaned and sealed from time to time. LWC Services of Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley’s professionally trained technicians can refurbish any scratched, etched, cracked, or damaged limestone and restore it to its original condition. Our 40 years of experience have enabled us to develop special processes to hone and/or polish and seal limestone to maximize its beauty and durability. Once we have completed a limestone restoration, our technicians will educate you with simple stone and tile care tips so you can keep your limestone looking like it was just installed.</p>
