					<p><strong>combustible dust removal</strong><br><br>LWC Services has performed combustible dust cleaning in a wide array of facilities throughout the United States and has dealt with many types of combustible dust. Keeping your facility clean and free of dust hazards can help you keep your workplace safe, and help avoid regulatory fines.<br><br><strong>Qualifications</strong><br><br>In <a href="#" id="textlink">OSHA’s Combustible Dust National Emphasis Program</a>, two of the most common citations were improper housekeeping, including combustible dust accumulation, and use of compressed air to blow down combustible dust. Hughes abides by standards set by the NFPA, NADCA, and OSHA when performing combustible dust cleaning.<br><br><strong>Safety Gear</strong><br><br>We also use proper PPE and our technicians are trained in OSHA’s 10- or 30-hour Safety, Aerial Lifts, Confined Spaces, First Aid, CPR, and Combustible Dust Safety and Awareness.<br><br>Using the wrong methods and equipment to clean combustible dust can be catastrophic. From protective clothing to vacuum hoses, we know that every piece of equipment counts when it comes to safety and compliance.<br><br><strong>Definition</strong><br><br>According to NFPA 654 “A combustible particulate solid that presents a fire or deflagration hazard when suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium over a range of concentrations, regardless of particle size or shape.”<br><br><strong>Necessary conditions for dust removal:</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li>– Combustible particulate solid small enough to be deflagrable.</li>
						<li>– Deflagrable particle suspended in air.</li>
						<li>– Deflagrable particulate of high enough concentration.</li>
						<li>– Adequate igniter.</li></ul></p>

					<h4>Masonry</h4><br><p>Our concrete mixture provides repairs in cracked or broken concrete and that are virtually undetectable. Traditional concrete is rated at 2500 psi; our concrete product is engineered to a 4200 psi rating.</p><br>
					<h4>Brick Restoration</h4><br><p>We use an industry-surpassing compound that provides seamless repair work to cracked brick and mortar on a structure or on a sidewalk or driveway. Traditional mortar is rated at 750 psi; our product is rated at 4200 psi.</p><br>
					<h4>Brick, mortar, and concrete painting/staining</h4><br><p>We worked diligently to create paint products that perfectly match existing colors and sustain through the changing weather climates of the Delaware Valley. These products should not fade, peel, or chip when properly applied, and our paints have a twenty-year life expectancy rate. Our paints are also heat, slip, and mildew resistant and never require a sealant.</p>

					<p>Limestone is a widely used architectural stone. Many of the world’s most recognized and loved landmarks, including the Great Pyramids, are constructed from this versatile, attractive stone. Limestone occurs in nature in varying degrees of hardness – some varieties are extremely soft – and like marble, limestone is very susceptible to acids, which can scratch and damage it.</p><br><br>
					<p>Caring for limestone effectively requires specialized knowledge because many types of limestone are extremely soft. Some varieties of limestone, particularly the softer varieties, need to be professionally cleaned and sealed from time to time. LWC Services of Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley’s professionally trained technicians can refurbish any scratched, etched, cracked, or damaged limestone and restore it to its original condition. Our 40 years of experience have enabled us to develop special processes to hone and/or polish and seal limestone to maximize its beauty and durability. Once we have completed a limestone restoration, our technicians will educate you with simple stone and tile care tips so you can keep your limestone looking like it was just installed.</p>
